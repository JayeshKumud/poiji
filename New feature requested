Hi, First of all thank you for making such helpful utility,
I have come across situation where I have to generate List from sheet, like below

@ExcelSheet("ModifyCustomerRequest")
public class ModifyCustomerRequest implements Request {

@ExcelCellName("accNum")
public String accNum;

public List<DocumentDetail> documentDetails;
//@ExcelSheet("DocumentDetail")
public static class DocumentDetail {

    @ExcelCellName("documentType")
    public int documentType;

    @ExcelCellName("documentStatus")
    public int documentStatus;
}
}

How would I achieve this, I have made separate sheet for DocumentDetail but still it doesn't work, Please help.
